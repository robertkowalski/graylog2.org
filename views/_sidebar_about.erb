<h2>Example use cases</h2>
<div class="sidebar-area">
  <h3>Monitoring</h3>
  Get alerts when the amount of new log messages reaches a defined maximum. Always have an
  overview of the log amount trends in good looking graphs just one click away. This is also
  possible on a per-stream level.
</div>

<div class="sidebar-area">
  <h3>API consumer measuring</h3>
  Create streams for every API consumer and quickly filter errors of certain consumers. Give
  these developers access to their own streams only and let them debug theirselves. Easily find
  out which consumers do the most requests on a certain resource.
</div>

<div class="sidebar-area">
  <h3>Activity log</h3>

  reporting abilities of Graylog2 to get an insight of what your users are doing and how they
