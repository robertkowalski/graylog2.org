  <h2>Simple log management</h2>
  <p>
  Graylog2 enables you to unleash the power that lays inside your logs. Use it to run analytics, alerting, monitoring and powerful searches over your
  whole log base. Need to debug a failing request? Just run a quick filter search to find it and see what errors it produced. Want to see all messages
  a certain API consumer is consuming in real time? Create streams for every consumer and have them always only one click away.
  </p>

  <h2>Free and open source</h2>
